/*NOTES

JUSTIFY-CONTENT
Below are five commonly used values for the justify-content property:

flex-start — all items will be positioned in order, starting from the left of the parent container, with no extra space between or before them.
flex-end — all items will be positioned in order, with the last item starting on the right side of the parent container, with no extra space between or after them.
center — all items will be positioned in order, in the center of the parent container with no extra space before, between, or after them.
space-around — items will be positioned with equal space before and after each item, resulting in double the space between elements.
space-between — items will be positioned with equal space between them, but no extra space before the first or after the last elements.

ALIGN-ITEMS
Below are five commonly used values for the align-items property:
flex-start — all elements will be positioned at the top of the parent container.
flex-end — all elements will be positioned at the bottom of the parent container.
center — the center of all elements will be positioned halfway between the top and bottom of the parent container.
baseline — the bottom of the content of all items will be aligned with each other.
stretch — if possible, the items will stretch from top to bottom of the container (this is the default value; elements with a specified height will not stretch; elements with a minimum height or no height specified will stretch).
